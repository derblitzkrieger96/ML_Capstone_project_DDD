# ML_Capstone_project_DDD

In this project I applied some basic maachine learning algorithms such as K Nearest Neighbor(KNN), Decision Tree, Support Vector Machine, and Logistic Regression to predict the state of a loan for different people based in another characteristics and then I used some metrics to decide what was the best model. I learned all of this from a IBM course at coursera: "Machine learning with python"
